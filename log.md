# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started working on Chapter 2 of the Hands on Guide to machine Learning

**Thoughts**: I'm enjoying how hands-on this book seems. I've done a lot of intro courses & reading into Machine Learning so it's nice to get my hands dirty on some implementation.

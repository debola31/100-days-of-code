# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started working on Chapter 2 of the Hands on Guide to machine Learning

**Thoughts**: I'm enjoying how hands-on this book seems. I've done a lot of intro courses & reading into Machine Learning so it's nice to get my hands dirty on some implementation.

### Day 1: September 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started working on refreshing my C++ skills using the codecademy course on C++

**Thoughts**: The codecademy course doesn't seem to be good way to learn. I'll switch to https://www.sololearn.com/Play/CPlusPlus#. I also want to finish the C++ refresher before the end of this week so I can start working on ROS projects. 

My goal for this 100 days of code are to:
1. Finish the Hands on Guide to Machine Learning.
2. Complete a refresher tutorial on C++.
3. Complete multiple projects in the ROS Robotics project book.

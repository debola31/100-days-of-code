# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started working on Chapter 2 of the "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow" Book.

**Thoughts**: I'm enjoying how hands-on this book seems. I've done a lot of intro courses & reading into Machine Learning so it's nice to get my hands dirty on some implementation. 

**Link(s) to work**: [Hands On ML](https://github.com/debola31/handson-ml)

### Day 1: September 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started working on refreshing my C++ skills using the codecademy course on C++

**Thoughts**: The codecademy course doesn't seem to be good way to learn. I'll switch to https://www.sololearn.com/Play/CPlusPlus#. I also want to finish the C++ refresher before the end of this week so I can start working on ROS projects. 

My goal for this 100 days of code are to:
1. Finish the Hands on Guide to Machine Learning.
2. Complete a refresher tutorial on C++.
3. Complete multiple projects in the ROS Robotics project book.

### Day 2: September 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: This day I finished Chapter 2 of the Hands-on Machine Learning Book. I set up my Kaggle Account Profile and wrote a test script to automate downloading data from Kaggle using their command line API.

**Thoughts**: It's interesting that kaggle has an API to automatically download data. It's mentioned in the machine learniatng book that you should automate as many steps of the ML process as you can including data gathering so it's nice to see their supporting best practices.
